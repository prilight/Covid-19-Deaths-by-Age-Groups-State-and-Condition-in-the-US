### Project Overview

The reason for this project is to understand factors contributing to COVID-19 deaths and provide actionable insights for healthcare planning and intervention strategies. I analyzed and predicted COVID-19 deaths using a dataset with information on conditions, states, age groups, and mentions in The United States of America.

### Data Sources

COVID-19 Deaths and Mentions in the United States by Age Group and Conditions: The primary dataset used for this project Conteined the number of deaths and mentions per medical conditions, age group and state in the US.

### Tools

-	Python: Data analyisis and manipulation.
-	Pandas and Numpy: Data preprocessing.
-	Scikit-Learn: Machine learning models.
-	Matplolib/Seaborn/Tableau: Data Visualization

### Approach
 
-	Analyze the relationship between health conditions and COVID-19 deaths.
-	Predict future COVID-19 deaths based on conditions and other factors.
-	Identify high-risk conditions and demographics
-	Determine geographical hotspots for COVID-19 deaths.
  
### Key Tasks:
-	Handled missing data, converted categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.
-	Examined the distribution of conditions across states and age groups, identified frequently mentioned conditions, and assessed their severity.
-	Found a strong positive correlation between condition mentions and COVID-19 deaths.
-	Built a Linear Regression Model with an R2 score on the test set, validated with a cross-validation achieving a mean R2 score of 0.900.
-	Evaluated using MAE, MSE, and conducted analysis.
-	Build a Dashboard in Tableau to visualize and tell a story behind the COVID cases in the US.
        
      
  ### Key Insights:
-	Identified which age group and states have the highest COVID-19 deaths.
-	Determined the most frequently mentioned conditions and their impact on mortality.
-	Provided insights into geographical hotspots and high-risk conditions.
